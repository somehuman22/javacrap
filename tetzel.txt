The document "Indulgences" by Johann Tetzel is about indulgences and the relief from purgatory that they provide. The purpose of the document is to persuade people to purchase 
indulences, threatening those who do not with a long time in a torturous purgatory. This practice caused controversy, as many people began to realize that the Church was scamming 
people using indulgences as a way to make money.
